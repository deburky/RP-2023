The idea to write this handbook came to me after I started to research convenient personal knowledge management tools to keep track of my library of web links and research papers about predictive models in the financial services domain, specifically in financial risk management. I decided to focus on the most developed areas of credit risk modeling, credit scoring, but hope to extend the handbook to cover more applied use-cases.

While one may come across many books on the topic, the examples provided may often appear too high-level for practical applications. There are several reasons why financial risk as a domain of specialty is special and not easy to unlock:

* Credit scoring a high-risk application of machine learning, which is governed by specific requirements for the end-to-end model development cycle. This is very different from a research process of unconstrained model prototyping aimed at maximimizing the accuracy metric.
* Financial data is one of the most valued assets according to <a href="https://edmcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/EDM_Council_Data_ROI_SIG_Value_of_Data_29_Mar_2023_.pdf">this study</a> and is one of the most expensive to obtain, which makes datasets used in modeling very specific to a lender.
* Internal tools developed for credit risk require a solid data foundation that puts a strong emphasis on the quality of data and its representativeness. These topics are almost never addressed in most books and guides.

This handbook is focused on Python and its scientific ecosystem. Some years ago, many players in the banking splace doubted that open-source software is going to replace their provider of choice. With Python, open-source credit risk management software is a reality, especially so in light of growing interest in large language models (LLMs) in Finance.

This handbook is an attempt to systematically collect relevant applied-focused materials that may be useful to a practitioner attempting to frame credit risk as a predictive modeling problem. Examples in the notebooks supplementing each chapter provide some examples of credit risk modeling work that can be extended to various real-world datasets.

    <h2>Why This Handbook?</h2>
    <p><span style="font-family: Karma, sans-serif;">Credit scoring has been around for quite a while, so why write another handbook about it? Despite extensive research published over the years, this specific predictive modeling domain is no easy topic to dive into. However, learning by practicing on real-world credit datasets can help develop a practical understanding of the problem, its specifics, and how it can be modelled.

    <h2>Why Python for Credit Risk Modeling?</h2>
    <p><span style="font-family: Karma, sans-serif;">Python is known as the lingua franca of data and is one of the most commonly used languages in the analytics and machine learning space. Using Python efficiently in credit risk modeling is essential for producing readable, production-grade code and improving the scalability of credit-risk models..</span></p>
